                0 : It is difficult to tell exactly what a person is doing or looks like based on an image. However, I can make some observations.  The image shows a group of people standing on a sidewalk.  They are casually dressed. One of the people in the group is wearing a yarmulke, which is a head covering worn by Jewish men. The group appears to be looking at something or someone across the street. 
                1 : A person is wearing blue jeans and a blue tank top with a gray sweatshirt wrapped around their waist. They are standing with a group of people in front of a building with a tree nearby. They are looking up and to the right, possibly watching something in the sky or on the roof of the building. 
                2 : The person in the photo has long brown hair and is wearing a black shirt, tan skirt, and black flats. They are walking in a crowd of people who are crossing a street.
